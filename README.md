# EndProjectInWebDevelopment
About the project:
The project was given by Mr.Srijan and Mr.Anmol, our mentors in web development classes. The project consist of image gallery,
video gallery and two games :Tic-Tac-Toe and Click-counter game.

Approach towards the project:
   In the project, being quite novice and amateur coder and also a first big try,
   I have tried to make the page simple looking,interface friendly and easily navigation access to webpagesâ€™ elements. 
   Dark theme has been applied as the demonstration of the webpages will be done in a dark room and also a dark theme makes it big unique 
   just like windows phone theme.

Conclusion:
   I have given my best efforts in making the web pages and I hope the viewers will like the pages.
